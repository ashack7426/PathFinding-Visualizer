This is my pathfinding visualizer. This program is able to simulate 5 diferent algorithms. These algorithms include A*, Dijkstras, Breadth_first_search, Depth_first_search, and Best_first_search.

## How to Use
left click - start, end, and walls

right click - undo start, end, and walls


space - run the algorithm

c - clear the screen

v - click to switch between showing visualizer or not showing visualizer


1 - switch to A*

2 - switch to Dijkstras

3 - switch to Breadth_first_search

4 - switch to Depth_first_search

5 - switch to Best_first_search
